# Instructions for Usage

The T piece will be assumed to be first in bag 2. If the T piece is not first, pretend the first piece is the T piece, and vice versa, and you can just swap it whenever the T piece eventually comes.

I use TIJLOSZ order, so if you are ever searching for a document/method with ctrl f, use that order. (exception being something like JJTZ/OOJL because that piece was duped).

Qbs are listed as an XY qb in any order (\[XY]!). If the qb requires a specific order of those pieces it will be listed as a “X,Y” or “Y,X” qb. 

For the summary, the top row is the first piece in the 2nd bag (excluding T) and the first column represents the 2nd piece in the 2nd bag.
# Missing 2nds
- Every 2nd with 1 T aren’t 100% T, with the exception of the two misc. cases listed above.
- Every 2nd with no T and no JL aren’t 100% T.
- Every 2nd with no T and odd JL are all 0% save T (into 3rd) due to columnar parity.
- Every other specific pc that does not follow these conditions are listed above.
